    <h3>Welcome to my project portfolio page</h3>
    <!--green text is hard to read against background picture-->
    <p>Within this site i will display my progress while on the IT: Front-end Developer VT 23 course.</p>
    <br>
    <!--Remove above BR, use margins and padding in CSS instead-->
    <!--Assignment 1 start-->
    <p><b>Assignment 1:</b></p>
    <p><i>Here it is, progress on day 1's first assignment (above). I've set up a HTML file, entered code and formatted the text. 
        The next thing is to figure out Git and GitHub.</i></p>
    <p><i>Day 2 has been about linking the code in Visual Studio Code with a GitHub repository and navigating GitBash. 
        GitBash is a kind of document control software that allows people to creat their own branches of the master file to work independantly and tracking changes.</i></p>
    <p><i>GitHub is a social platform where code is shared with other users.</i></p>
    <!--change the above desciption and formatting later, need better skills first!-->
    <!--Assignment 1 end-->

            <p><b>Assignment 2 is split into 2 sections, the first further explores html codes, inserts navigation functions, creates ordered and unordered lists and hyperlinks, and the addition of images. 
                The section section looks into CSS styles which enables us to set the text formatting. The best practice method is to create a separate CSS style sheet and link it in the "head" section. </b></p>

        <section id="internal-link">
            <p>Assigment 2 html codes - the code is now written under "main" with "sections" and "paragraphs" indented under it.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Navigation functions - 2 navigations functions have been added to my code, an external link which takes the user to an external page (my GitHub page), and an internal link which takes the user to a section within the page (this section). 
                These naviation functions are locted in the unordered and ordered lists above.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>Images - I've downloaded a free to use image from pexels, saved it in images folder, created a "src" link, added attributes and resized. I have inserted a picture with an incorrect link to show the title attribute i have included in the code.</p>
            <!--below picture downloaded from pexels.com-->
            <img src="Images/Cornwall.jpg" alt="Cornwall" title="Cornish Beach" width="400" height="400">
            <!--inline picture size not correct way, should be in index.css-->
            <img src="Images/Cornwall." alt="Cornwall" title="Cornish Beach">
            <!--Incorrect file name on second image-->
        </section>
        <section> 
            <p id="style">CSS styles - I have created an external styles sheet (index.CSS) which sets the color for each of my headings (h1,h2, h3, etc.) and linked this in the head section. 
                I have created an internal style for h1 and a CSS linked style id for this section to prove the hierarchy of syles.</p>
            <p class="class-link">CSS linked "class"</p>
            <p class="second">A second "class" to test the color linking of 2 classes</p>
            <p> The "h1" heading has been formatted in CSS and the following updated: color, font size, font weight, font style, text align, background color</p>
            <!--insert screenshot of the CSS code once image sizing is learnt-->
